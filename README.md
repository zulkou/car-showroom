## Project Setup

This Django project is designed to manage car payment plan. It includes features such as count car payment based of down payment, annual interest, cost of service, etc.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or later
- [Any other required dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, etc.)]

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    - If you're using the default SQLite database, it will be automatically set up.
    - For PostgreSQL or other databases, update your `settings.py` with the correct database configuration.
    - Use `.env.example` to setup your own database credentials.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser (optional but recommended):**
    If you want to access the Django admin, create a superuser.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Configuration

- In your `settings.py`, make sure to configure the correct environment variables and any other settings necessary (e.g., `DATABASES`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, etc.).
- For local development, it's common to use `.env` files for sensitive data like API keys or database credentials.

## Running the Project

To start the Django development server, use:

```bash
python manage.py runserve
```
Your project will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
